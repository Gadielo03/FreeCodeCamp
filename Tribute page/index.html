                <p>Ash Ketchum, known as Satoshi (サトシ) in Japan, is a character in the Pokémon franchise owned by Nintendo, Game Freak, and Creatures. He was the protagonist of the Pokémon anime for the first 25 seasons, as well as the protagonist of several manga series. In Japanese, the character is voiced by Rica Matsumoto. In the English dub, he was voiced by Veronica Taylor in the first eight seasons and has been voiced by Sarah Natochenny since the ninth season. Ash is a young man who travels with various companions, aiming to fulfill his dream to become a Pokémon Master; his Pokémon lineup constantly changes over the course of the series, with its sole constant member being Pikachu. Ash is loosely based on Red, the player character from the Generation I games Pokémon Red, Blue, and Green. Satoshi Tajiri, the creator of Pokémon, has stated that Ash represents the 'human aspect' of the series, and that Ash reflects what he himself was like as a child.

            <div id="Badge"><img src="/FreeCodeCamp/Tribute page/src/badges/boulder badge.png" alt="" width="100px" height="100px"><p><span class="bold">Boulder Badge:</span>Ash gets molly whopped in his first battle against a Gym Leader. In the rematch against Brock, Ash still stands no chance, but Pikachu's sparks inadvertently cause the sprinklers to go off, damaging Onix and giving Ash an opening. Before Ash delivers the final blow, Brock's siblings plead with him not to hurt Onix, apparently unfamiliar with how Pokémon battles work. Ash generously forfeits, but Brock insists that Ash take the Badge anyway because of the kindness he showed by needlessly forfeiting a match he was about to win.</p></div>
            <div id="Badge"><img src="/FreeCodeCamp/Tribute page/src/badges/cascade badge.png" alt="" width="100px" height="100px"><p><span class="bold">Cascade Badge:</span>When one of Misty's sisters offers Ash a free Gym Badge, he hilariously responds that he prefers to earn his badges, despite currently being 0 for 1 in the "earned his badges" department. After this ironic foreshadowing, Ash accepts a Gym Battle with Misty. The battle's interrupted when Team Rocket attacks the Gym, attempting to steal all the Water-type Pokémon. Once Ash and Pikachu defeat Team Rocket and rescue the Pokémon, Misty's sisters give Ash the Badge as thanks for protecting the Gym.</p></div>
            <div id="Badge"><img src="/FreeCodeCamp/Tribute page/src/badges/earth badge.png" alt="" width="100px" height="100px">  <p><span class="bold">Earth Badge:</span>Nothing will ever top the chaos of Ash's experience at the Viridian City Gym. With Team Rocket filling in as Gym Leaders, Jessie sent out three Pokémon at once while she and Ash stood on platforms that electrocute trainers while Gary Oak had a fistfight with Meowth. For the second time in Ash's Kanto Gym Challenge, Team Rocket blows up the gym that he's in. As Team Rockets hurtles off into the sky, the Earth Badge conveniently floats down into Ash's hand as the building collapses. Apparently, Badges still count if the trainer didn't defeat any Pokémon or even face the actual Gym Leader.</p></div>
            <div id="Badge"><img src="/FreeCodeCamp/Tribute page/src/badges/marsh badge.png" alt="" width="100px" height="100px">  <p><span class="bold">Marsh Badge:</span>The most infamous example of Ash's constant circumvention of Pokémon League regulations, Ash's "Gym Battle" against Sabrina is one for the ages. After his first obligatory loss, Ash befriends a wild Haunter to help him with his rematch. Haunter, ever the troll, abandons Ash at the start of the battle. It quickly reappears and begins making silly faces that cause the stoic and creepy Sabrina to laugh so hysterically that the battle just… ends. Her father insists that Ash take the Marsh Badge as thanks for making his daughter laugh.</p></div>
            <div id="Badge"><img src="/FreeCodeCamp/Tribute page/src/badges/rainbow badge.png" alt="" width="100px" height="100px"><p><span class="bold">Rainbow Badge:</span>This time around, Ash didn't get a chance to lose his first match, even though he was about to. During the battle, Team Rocket drops into the building carrying a bomb that Meowth inexplicably detonates while still holding, causing them to get sent blasting off again as the building catches fire. When the Gym Leader's Gloom is trapped inside, Ash rushes back into the burning building and rescues it. As thanks, Erika awards Ash his fifth badge.</p></div>
            <div id="Badge"><img src="/FreeCodeCamp/Tribute page/src/badges/soul badge.png" alt="" width="100px" height="100px">   <p><span class="bold">Soul Badge:</span>Impressively, it only took Ash until the sixth Gym to earn a Badge on his first try. After a prolonged interruption by Team Rocket, Ash's Charmander defeats Koga's Golbat, winning the Soul Badge. Although, Ash never would've won were it not for Misty's Psyduck, as it was the only Pokémon that was able to fight off Team Rocket so Ash could resume his match. Ash might be the only trainer in history to owe his victory in a Gym Battle to someone else's Pokémon.</p></div>
            <div id="Badge"><img src="/FreeCodeCamp/Tribute page/src/badges/thunder badge.png" alt="" width="100px" height="100px"><p><span class="bold">Thunder Badge:</span>In Ash's first battle against Lt. Surge, the eight-foot-tall behemoth's Raichu nearly sends Ash's Pikachu to meet Arceus. Ash's subsequent rematch features one of the first examples of his trademark creativity in battle when Pikachu uses its tail as a ground to avoid damage from Raichu's Thunderbolt. In a sentence that only makes sense in Pokémon, Ash's fifth battle against a Gym Leader results in his first victory for his third badge.</p></div>
            <div id="Badge"><img src="/FreeCodeCamp/Tribute page/src/badges/volcano badge.png" alt="" width="100px" height="100px"><p><span class="bold">Volcano Badge:</span>Ash was right to surrender his first match against Blaine to avoid Pikachu possibly meeting a fiery end. Blaine should probably be barred from being a Gym Leader for forcing Pokémon to fight above a pit of lava. This victory deserves an asterisk, though, because Ash's Charizard pretty much commanded itself in battle and emerged victorious while Ash happened to be standing nearby. Charizard does belong to Ash though and did heed two of his orders during the match, so Ash kind of earned the badge.</p></div>
